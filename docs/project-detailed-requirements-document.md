## Project Overview
The Journal application is a web-based platform that allows a content manager to create and manage journal articles. Articles are written in Markdown format and can include text, lists, links, images, and other Markdown-supported features. Users can view a list of articles sorted by date and read individual articles rendered from Markdown to HTML.

## Objectives
- Develop a web application with a frontend and backend.
- Utilize Docker and Docker Compose for easy deployment.
- Implement React and Node.js with an appropriate framework (e.g., Next.js).
- Include testing methodologies to ensure code quality.
- Design the application for both local and cloud deployment.
- Simplify content management by allowing direct Markdown file submissions.

## Functional Requirements

### User Interface
- **Homepage**:
  - Display a list of journal articles sorted by date (newest first).
  - Each article entry shows the title and publication date.
  - Clicking on an article redirects to the article detail view.
  
- **Article Detail View**:
  - Render the article content from Markdown to HTML.
  - Support text formatting, lists, links, images, etc.

- **Navigation Menu**:
  - Include links to the homepage and content submission page (for the content manager).

- **Responsive Design**:
  - Ensure the application is usable on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

### Article Management
- **Article Storage**:
  - Store articles as Markdown (.md) files on the server.
  - Each article includes metadata (title, date, author).
  
- **Article Retrieval**:
  - The frontend requests the list of articles from the backend API.
  - Articles are fetched dynamically to allow for updates without redeploying.

- **Sorting and Filtering**:
  - Articles are sorted by date by default.
  - (Optional) Implement filters by category or tags.

### Content Submission
- **Content Submission Page**:
  - Accessible only to the content manager.
  - Provide a form to create new articles:
    - Title
    - Publication Date (default to current date)
    - Markdown Editor/Textarea
  
  - Submit button to save the article.
  
- **File Handling**:
  - Validate the Markdown content before saving.
  - Store the Markdown file on the server in a designated directory.

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Single User Authentication**:
  - Implement basic authentication for the content manager.
  - Secure the content submission page and related API endpoints.
  - Store credentials securely (hashed passwords).

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- **Load Times**:
  - Optimize assets and code to ensure quick load times.
  - Implement code splitting and lazy loading where appropriate.

- **API Efficiency**:
  - Ensure API endpoints respond promptly.
  - Optimize database queries and file I/O operations.

### Scalability
- **Horizontal Scalability**:
  - Design the application to run across multiple servers if needed.
  - Use stateless services where possible.

- **Database Scalability**:
  - Optimize database schema and indexing for performance.

### Security
- **Data Protection**:
  - Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
  - Use HTTPS for data transmission (especially when deployed on the cloud).

- **Authentication Security**:
  - Use secure password storage (e.g., bcrypt hashing).
  - Implement session management and timeout features.

### Usability
- **Accessibility**:
  - Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines to make the application accessible to users with disabilities.
  
- **User Experience**:
  - Intuitive navigation and interface.
  - Provide feedback on user actions (e.g., submission success messages).

## Technical Specifications

### Frontend
- **Framework**:
  - Use Next.js for server-side rendering and routing.
  
- **Libraries**:
  - React for building UI components.
  - react-markdown or Markdown-it for rendering Markdown content.
  - Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests to the backend.
  
- **Styling**:
  - Use CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or Emotion.
  - Alternatively, use CSS Modules or traditional CSS/SCSS.
  
- **State Management**:
  - Use React's built-in state management or consider Redux if necessary.

### Backend
- **Runtime Environment**:
  - Node.js for server-side JavaScript execution.
  
- **Framework**:
  - Express.js for building RESTful APIs.
  
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/articles` - Retrieve a list of articles with metadata.
  - `GET /api/articles/:id` - Retrieve a specific article's content.
  - `POST /api/articles` - Submit a new article (protected endpoint).
  
- **Middleware**:
  - Use middleware for authentication, logging, and error handling.

### Database
- **Database Choice**:
  - MySQL for storing article metadata and user credentials.

- **ORM/Database Library**:
  - Use Sequelize or Prisma for object-relational mapping.

- **Schema Design**:
  - **Articles Table**:
    - `id` (primary key)
    - `title`
    - `date_published`
    - `file_path` (path to the Markdown file)
  
  - **Users Table**:
    - `id` (primary key)
    - `username`
    - `password_hash`

### Deployment
- **Containerization**:
  - Use Docker to containerize the frontend and backend applications.
  - Create separate Dockerfiles for frontend and backend services.
  
- **Orchestration**:
  - Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container deployment.
  - Define services, networks, and volumes in docker-compose.yml.
  
- **Cloud Deployment**:
  - Prepare the application for deployment on platforms like AWS, Azure, or DigitalOcean.
  - Ensure environment variables and configurations are easily adjustable.

## Testing Requirements

### Testing Types

  - Ensure the frontend and backend communicate correctly.
  
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing**:
  - Simulate user interactions from start to finish.
  - Test user flows like viewing articles and submitting new content.

### Tools and Frameworks
- **Frontend Testing**:
  - Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests.
  - Cypress or Selenium for end-to-end tests.
  
- **Backend Testing**:
  - Mocha and Chai or Jest for unit and integration tests.
  - Use Supertest for testing HTTP endpoints.
  
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
  - Set up CI pipelines using GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, or Jenkins.
  - Automate testing and deployment processes.

## Architecture
- **Client-Server Model**:
  - Frontend: Next.js application serving React components.
  - Backend: Express.js API handling data retrieval and content submission.

- **API Design**:
  - RESTful API adhering to standard HTTP methods and status codes.

- **Data Flow**:
  - Frontend requests data from the backend via API calls.
  - Backend interacts with the database and file system to serve data.

- **File Storage**:
  - Markdown files stored in a designated directory on the server.
  - File paths stored in the database for reference.

## Documentation
- **Code Documentation**:
  - Use JSDoc or similar tools to document functions and modules.
  
- **API Documentation**:
  - Create API documentation using tools like Swagger or API Blueprint.
  
- **User Guides**:
  - Provide instructions for content managers on how to submit articles.
  - Include deployment guides for setting up the application locally and on the cloud.

## Conclusion
This requirements document serves as a comprehensive guide for developing the Journal application using AIDD. By adhering to these specifications, we aim to create a robust, scalable, and user-friendly platform for managing and viewing journal articles. The use of modern technologies and best practices will ensure the application's maintainability and ease of deployment.

**Next Steps**:
- Review this document to ensure all requirements are met.
